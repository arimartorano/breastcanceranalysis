October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and in honor of the fighters, survivors, and, allies I thought it would be helpful and informative to analyze breast cancer. This project aims to analyze breast cancer data while providing insights into key features and creating a predicitve model to aid in the early dectection of breast cancer. This research can potientally guide scientist to finding the cure. This will be benefical to the entire human race. Breast Cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among U.S. women. Each year about 30% of all newly diagnosed cancers in women are breast cancer. 13% of U.S. women are going to develop invasive breast cancer in the course of their life. This is where we merge healthcare technology. This is where we fight! This project was built using sklearn,sklearn.linear_model,sklearn.metrics,sklearn.neighbors,sklearn.ensemble and python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy,and matplotlib.

As always in order to get started I had to clean the csv file, using python functions and libraries then dropped all the null values. Once the data was validated it was time to dive into the EDA and the CDA  by using logistic regression, random forest classifer, and bagging classifer.
